# School Pocket
A very simple web app to manage a student's career written in Ruby using Ruby on Rails framework

Recap
------------------
This project began as a high school graduation project written entirely in PHP.
Subsequently it was rewritten in Ruby and Python (using RoR and Flask), to improve my webdev skills.
